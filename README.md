##Final Project for TIY
Well, here we are. Planning for the last project we do at The Iron Yard.

##Idea #1 - Bridges Career Exploration Day "Day-of-event" App.
Probably not the title of the app, but this is what it is. [Bridges Career Academies and Workplace Connection](http://www.bridgesconnection.org) is a non-profit whose main focus is working with highschools and colleges in an effort to better serve the student's in giving them the education and information needed to make better career decisions. Not only that, but working with businesses in the Brainerd Lakes Area to learn about job/skill needs in order to create a more prepared workforce.

At the end of the school year (first week of march) Bridges holds a Career Exploration Day in which 2500 students ranging from 9th to 12th grade converge on Central Lakes College in Brainerd, MN for a day of hands-on exploration into hundreds of different career options in many different types of business. Hundreds of volunteers donate their time to represent their careers (while not selling or promoting their businesses) and dedicating their time to educate students.

###So, what's the problem?
Currently, Bridges pays thousands of dollars every year (which changes every year) on marketing design for flyers, cards that require the students to communicate with business to have them check off enough boxes to be eligible to win prizes, colored paper maps, and printed paper forms that show off the business, wages and career information that go into 2400 plastic bags and end up scattered on the floors of the college at the end of the day. 

I believe I can save them money by condensing this whole process into a downloadable app capable of being customized even more to better educate the students they spend so much time trying to reach.

###What you can expect from the app
When the student downloads the app, they will see what's new at this CED or what the showcase cluster will be. The new, color-coordinated map will be accessible as well, helping with quick direction while navigating the college. From here, the kids can choose from the mobile menu above (or via map) if they'd like to see the list of business involved in the day's event, careers being represented, wage and salary information (retrieved from the department of labor and MN DEED). Another fun option they will have is the ability to be able to upload updates to their social media about the event.

One of the biggest challenges of this extremely big event is the busing and scheduling for 20+ schools and 2400 students/teachers. It has always been something that has taken the most time and has always been a struggle to get perfectly. With the app, the students will be able to see exactly when their bus will depart the college. On top of having the convenient schedule, the students will be notified before the scheduled departure time via an alarm (or potentially text) that it is time to head towards the meeting place to leave. The exit door each school will be using will also be marked clearly on the map in the "Bus Schedule" page. There will also be an input that will allow the student to add in which number of the bus they arrived in to prevent any confusion.

The final page will be the mini-game going on during the event. Each student is asked to participate, ask questions and get involved in the learning process. To help with that, Bridges has items, gift cards and iPads as giveaways during the event. Students are currently required to ask questions to the business volunteers about their careers, what they do, etc. and receive a checkmark or initials. There is a minimum required amount of marks to turn in for a chance in a drawing, but are given more entries if the student goes above and beyond. With the app, this process will be automated. 

Each business cluster and volunteers will be given a certain code that then can be input into the student's phone as their entry. When they reach the minimal amount of entries, they will have an alert to tell them they can either "Submit me for drawing now!" or "I want to keep going! I'll submit later!". The student will then fill out his/her name, school, email and phone number and send it off to be thrown into the drawing.


###Why am I making this app?
As a highschool and into my college years, I was the unfortunate example and reason this non-profit exists. My first two years were the beginnings of me spinning my wheels with no direction or preparations. College preparation was extremely scarce and absolutely lacking in my school, or anywhere for that matter. Kids were coming out of highschool and were forced to pay outrageous tuition costs on classes and degrees they, ultimately, had no interest in doing. It was just "how it was". We had no way of preparation, we could go talk to people about their jobs, but it wasn't easy to do. We, as students and the future workforce, had no connection with the workplace or business community in general.

Bridges is an evergrowing passion of mine. My mother started it 10 years ago and everything they do is for the community and for the kids/future workforce. This program has strengthened the workforce/workplace community in the Brainerd Lakes Area ten fold, allowing for better communication between the two entities and ultimately creating a more passionate workforce that stick around and build and invest into communities. That gap between the employee and employer is shrinking and has become more friendly.

I have also worked many years with this business and have a lot of knowledge of it's workings. This app could save the company so much money, which ultimately goes right back into the community in terms of more projects and immersion camps, speakers in the classroom, more career-oriented programs in the highschools for students to take, job shadowing opportunities and so much more.

It's not just that I want to make this, it's that I need to.

###Priority, Impact and Mystery/Mastery
This is one of the tougher things for me. As someone who knows the business, a lot of things for this would be high priority and high impact, but we'll give it a shot here.

####Priority and Impact
#####High Priority
The highest priority and highest impact item for me in this is definitely the information from Dept. of Labor and MN DEED. Having it clear, concise and complete is very important to me. I don't want to develop something with poor information. Without it, the whole project is just a flashy bunch of hard-coded information with no real purpose. The information gathered is wage information, job description, job demand (high-med-low), skill requirement and educational requirements. It is the heart and soul of the project as the Career Exploration Day is about getting as many of this future workforce educated on their options and prepare them for the decisions ahead of them.

The bus schedule/alarm item, personally, is very high for both as well. I've been in charge of the busing portion of this event and I can say it's very stressful for those involved. You never have enough volunteers to direct people and we were always looking for kids, which make busses late and mess up the whole parking/moving situation in the small area the busses are in.

Having a solid toast to say their submission worked with their codes, while being able to send with it the amount of codes they were able to receive.

#####Low Priority
The clickable/interactive map of the college is close to being high priority, but can be worked around and becomes lower priority with medium impact. It would simplify the interaction for the students if they could just click on the sections rather than having to search for them through the app.

Heavy design is a little lower on my priority list for this. I really want it to look solid and clean, but functionality with something like this is definitely more important. The design can always be altered and cleaned up while we go. Obviously, this has a definitely higher impact if it looks good, but I'd rather it have solid lines, clean, fast and straight forward.

#####Mystery/Mastery

#####Mystery
How the API's are going to(if they do) work. We've retrieved data from API's before, but every one has been different and they've all had their own tricks to them. It's always a mystery.

Will I be able to break up this map into interactive pieces? Where do I send the submission codes when they've completed it and how will I show it in my presentation?

Using react-native is still a mystery to me, though I feel after this I may be a master. Who knows!

#####Mastery
Design and styling itself is coming together in my head a little bit, I know how to design and style so it won't be as big of an impact on the mental process of this project.

I know this business very well. The process, the production and the interactions. I have resources at my disposal that can really help me create something very good here.


###Now for the hard part - Focus!
I have such a hard time focusing on things sometimes. I can go for a few hours and work like mad, but once I'm off that train it's hard for me to jump back on. So, I've come up with a few ways to fight this;

+ Music - if I have my headphones on I'm probably non-existent on this world. It shuts me off from it and allows me to focus on what is most important. It's interesting that, if I just sit down and put something on, I actually can hop back on that train.
+ Break, break, break - I know that if I get discouraged, I actually start working a little harder, but sooner or later it starts to get to me. I plan on taking breaks and pulling myself back together.
+ Finishing things one at a time - No more 90% completes. It's 100% or I don't move on. If I don't do this, I get overwhelmed by what still needs to be done...which brings me to the last one.
+ ONE. THING. AT. A. TIME - fin. period.

I haven't completed my plan yet for the project, but the design phase is well on it's way. The color palette has been chosen, I've started gathering MN DEED and Dept of Labor api information that I'll be combing through. 

This will be a test to my patience, my abilities and my passions. I feel up to it, I'm mentally ready to go and I'm excited to get on it.
